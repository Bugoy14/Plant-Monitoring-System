# Plant Monitoring System
Thesis Project

Concepts Used:

Renewable Energy
Agriculture
Automation
Web Server
Equiptments Used:

Arduino Uno R3 - to gather the data from the sensors
ESP8266 - local websever to display the data remotely from smartphone or PC
Solar Panel and a 12v Battery - for renewable energy to power the device
Solar Charge Controller - to prevent the battery from overcharging
Soil Moisture, Temperature, and Humidity sensor - to gather data of the plant
LCD - to display the data gathered by the sensors
Solenoid Valve - Automatically waters the plant when the value of the sensors drops
Relay - to protect the devices from high voltage allowing safe connection between the battery
