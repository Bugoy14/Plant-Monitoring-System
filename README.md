# Plant Monitoring System
Thesis Project

Concepts Used:

1. Renewable Energy
2. Agriculture
3. Automation
4. Web Server

Equiptments Used:
1. Arduino Uno R3 - to gather the data from the sensors
2. ESP8266 - local websever to display the data remotely from smartphone or PC
3. Solar Panel and a 12v Battery - for renewable energy to power the device
4. Solar Charge Controller - to prevent the battery from overcharging
5. Soil Moisture, Temperature, and Humidity sensor - to gather data of the plant
6. LCD - to display the data gathered by the sensors
7. Solenoid Valve - Automatically waters the plant when the value of the sensors drops
8. Relay - to protect the devices from high voltage allowing safe connection between the battery
